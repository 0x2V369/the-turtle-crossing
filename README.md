# The Turtle Crossing

Welcome to *The Turtle Crossing* game, a fun and interactive Python project inspired by the classic arcade game Frogger. In this game, you guide a turtle across a busy road while avoiding speeding cars to reach the other side.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Use the `Up` arrow key to move the turtle forward. The game increases in difficulty as you progress.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cars move at varying speeds and appear randomly to challenge the player.
- **Score Tracking**: Your progress is tracked by how many times you successfully cross the road.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main game loop and logic.
- `turtle_player.py`: Manages the turtle player's movement.
- `car_manager.py`: Handles the car obstacles.
- `scoreboard.py`: Tracks and displays the player's score.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed.
3. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x2V369/the-turtle-crossing.git
